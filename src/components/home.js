Owners of MoodStreem assets will be able to vote on and propose changes for the development and administration teams to implement. Voting power will be weighted based on an asset's tier and popularity. For instance, assets representing content will give owners greater voting power proportional to the amount of views and other trackable activity the content has contributed to the platform. </div>
